About Me
======
I am a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), advised by Dr. Jing Ma.

My goal is to construct virtual character dialogue agents that can hold long-term memories, maintain character consistency, and motivate social phobia in real life to become happy. 


**Research Interests**
- Natural Language Processing
- Dialog System
- Large Language Model - **Role-played LLMs**
- **Controllable Text Generation - Persona Control**
- Fraud Detection
